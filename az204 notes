Always On: Keeps the app loaded even when there's no traffic. When Always On isn't turned on (default), the app is unloaded after 20 minutes without any incoming requests. 
The unloaded app can cause high latency for new requests because of its warm-up time. When Always On is turned on, the front-end load balancer sends a GET request to the application
root every five minutes. The continuous ping prevents the app from being unloaded.
